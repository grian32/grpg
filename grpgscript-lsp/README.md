# GRPGScript LSP

This repo contains the LSP for GRPGScript, along with a Zed plugin that integrates it and the GRPGScript Tree-Sitter located at https://github.com/grian32/tree-sitter-grpgscript

Note: Both the plugins and the LSP are made with GRPG in mind, and as such provide autocomplete/mocking/highlighting/etc for it's builtins. If you're using GRPGScript independently of GRPG, you may want to change this.
