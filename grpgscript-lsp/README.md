# GRPGScript LSP

This repo contains the LSP for GRPGScript, along with a Zed plugin that integrates it and the GRPGScript Tree-Sitter located at https://github.com/grian32/tree-sitter-grpgscript

Note: The Zed Plugin ships a highlights.scm that also highlights GRPG's game builtins as such. If GRPGScript is used independently of GRPG, you may want to change this.
